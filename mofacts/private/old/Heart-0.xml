        <unitinstructions><![CDATA[<b>The Circulatory System <br><br>

The Heart</b><br>

       <p>An adult's heart is about the size of a large orange and weighs a little less than a pound. It is hollow and can fill up with blood. The heart is in the middle of the chest. It fits snugly between the two lungs. The pointed tip at the bottom of the heart touches the front wall of the chest. Every time the heart beats, it goes 'thump' against the chest wall. 
<br>
       <p>The heart is a pump. Its walls are made of thick muscle. They can squeeze (contract) to send blood rushing out. The blood flows smoothly in tubes called blood vessels.First the blood flows into tubes called arteries. The arteries that leave the heart are thick tubes. But the arteries soon branch again and again, to form many smaller tubes. These blood vessels carry blood to all parts of the body.
 <br>
       <p>The farther from the heart, the more blood vessels there are. The tiniest blood vessels, called capillaries, are so small you would need a microscope to see them. Capillaries join to form larger blood vessels. These tubes carry blood back toward the heart. The bigger ones are called veins. The closer to the heart, the fewer the veins there are, and the larger they are. Therefore, the blood vessels carry blood in a circle. First moving away from the heart in the arteries, then traveling to various parts of the body in capillaries, and lastly going back to the heart through the veins.
<br>
       <p>If you could see inside your heart you would see that a vertical wall of (solid) muscle divides it down the middle, into a left half and a right half. The muscular wall is called a septum. Another septum in the heart is horizontal and separates the rounded top part of the heart from the cone-shaped bottom part. So there are actually four chambers (spaces) inside the heart. Each top chamber is called an atrium (plural: atria) and can be thought of as "receiving" chambers. The bottom chambers are called ventricles and can be thought of as "discharging" chambers. Blood can flow from the atria down into the ventricles, because there are openings in the horizontal septum that separates them. But the vertical septum is solid, with no openings.
<br><br>
<b>The Circulation of Blood</b><br>

       <p>The circulatory system is actually made up of two circles. The heart is a double pump whose two parts work in unison. The right side receives the blood from veins and pumps it to the lungs; the left side receives the blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body. Blood cannot flow back and forth between the left and right halves of the heart, because the septum that separates them is solid, keeping the two circles separate.
<br>
       <p>The left ventricle of the heart sends blood out through a big artery and from there, into branching arteries that carry it to various parts of the body. The veins that carry blood back from the body parts empty the blood into the right atrium of the heart. The blood then flows down into the right ventricle, which pumps it into the lungs and back to the heart, into the left atrium. From there the blood flows into the left ventricle, where it is once again pumped out into the body.
<br>
       <p>All the cells of the body need energy to do their work. They get energy by combining sugars or other food materials with oxygen. When a body cell combines sugar with oxygen to get energy, carbon dioxide is formed. But too much carbon dioxide could poison a cell. So, all the body cells need some way to get oxygen and some way to get rid of carbon dioxide.
<br>
       <p>The blood does both these things. It brings oxygen to the body cells and takes away their carbon dioxide. These gases pass easily back and forth through the thin walls of the tiny capillaries. Both oxygen and carbon dioxide are carried in the blood mainly by the red blood cells. These tiny cells are like little ferry boats. They float along in the blood, carrying their cargoes of oxygen or carbon dioxide. As the blood flows through the capillaries in the body, carrying its supply of oxygen, it also collects carbon dioxide. The blood is then returned to the right atrium. The blood is then pumped into the right ventricle, and then to the lungs.
<br>
       <p>Inside the lungs there are many tiny air sacs called alveoli. They are wrapped in a network of tiny capillaries. Blood from the heart flows through these capillaries, passing carbon dioxide into the tiny air sacs. When you breathe out, you get rid of this carbon dioxide. Oxygen from the air sacs, obtained from breathing in, then passes into the blood capillaries. The oxygen-rich blood is returned to the left atrium of the heart and pumped out to the body through the left ventricle. Thus, the circle begins again. Even though it is the same blood that carried the carbon dioxide wastes, it has now unloaded them and taken on a new cargo of oxygen.
<br><br> 
<b>The Heartbeat</b><br>
       <p>A heartbeat has two parts. First the heart muscle contracts. The contraction starts with the atria, which push blood into the ventricles. Then the walls of the ventricles squeeze together and force the blood out into the arteries. The contraction is the first part of the heartbeat. After that, the heart muscle relaxes, which is the second part of the heartbeat. This allows the heart to get large again, and blood can flow into the atria from the veins.
<br> 
       <p>Blood cannot flow backward into the arteries because little trapdoors called valves stop it. Valves also guard the openings from the atria into the ventricles. So there is always one-way traffic in the heart. The valves keep blood from flowing backward. These valves, and every other component discussed in this text, are essential in maintaining a healthy heart and normal blood circulation.]]>

        <unitinstructions><![CDATA[You will now begin the practice portion. This portion consists of 32 trials. The questions will either be in multiple choice or short answer format. The questions are  related to the material you just read, but may require some additional reasoning on your part.<br><br>
            You will receive corrective feedback for each item. This means if you get the answer correct, a "Correct" message notification will briefly appear in a green box underneath your answer. If you get the answer incorrect, you will receive a Review Period during which the correct answer will be shown in a red box at the bottom of the screen. These Review Periods last 10 seconds, which is longer than the Correct notification, so it is in your best interest to try your best to get them correct, so you can finish the experiment more quickly.

            <b>Remember that you are not allowed to take notes or "look up" any answers.</b> If you do not start typing (for short answer questions) or select your answer (for multiple choice questions) within 20 seconds, the system will count that as incorrect and move you on to the next question.
